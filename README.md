# Individual Project: ColorP [(PIs)](https://git.lindblom.tech/quinnc/COLLINS2018_CoursePortfolio/blob/master/ColorP.md)


An application that reads notes played through a computer keyboard or a digital piano and produces the following
* A description of the note(s) played (What chord is being played, what appregio is being played)
* Splashes of color on the screen that correlate with the note(s) you’re playing
* I would like the color aspects to be done in glsl but this might increase the complexity a bit but also allow for more creative flexibility
* If I get to it, some form of 3D textures that correlate with the notes I don’t know how.

ColorP will be made in Processing Python, which will allow me to use GLSL. I will do my best to get as in depth in GLSL as possible and produce a visually pleasing experience

I plan to have multiple "Formats" that the user can choose from, these "Formats" will essentially be how the feedback of their presses will be produced. For example, a layout could be various glowing balls that grow bigger as a note is pressed.


###### I hope to be able to support:
* Keyboard Input
* MIDI Input
* MIDI Files

###### Tools
* Processing
* glslviewer
